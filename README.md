### Hello!

I am a software develeoper who codes next to my nine cats and six dogs...just kidding, I actually maintain a growing flock of rubber duckies.  In additon to coding, I also enjoy volunteering with Reading partners, lifting weights, running and crocheting.  I am always on the lookout for neat projects to join!
